First of all I downloaded the latest .iso with Ubuntu on it
and made my USB stick bootable with the .iso on it.
Went to the BIOS, changed boot order, and it booted the content
on the USB. 
Launched Ubuntu in compatibility mode because of some technical
errors, but still managed to install normal version of Ubuntu 
and made sure to check the box to install drivers as well.
After Ubuntu was installed, I booted it and installed zsh 
and oh-my-zsh and made it default.
Created the helloworld.c file using terminal and made all 
changes through terminal.
Created Makefile through terminal that makes helloworld executable.
Initiated a git repo and added all files to it.
Made a commit and pushed changes in github through token.
Now created README through terminal and editing it in nano as well.
I'm going to upload screenshots and this readme to git.
